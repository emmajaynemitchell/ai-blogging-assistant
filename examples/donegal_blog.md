# A Weekend in Donegal, Ireland

## Discovering the Magic of the Wild Atlantic Way

I am so lucky tha I'm from the beautiful Donegal on Ireland's northwestern coast. From the dramatic cliffs to the welcoming locals, this county is perfect for a three day visit.

### Arriving in Donegal Town

After a scenic drive through the Irish countryside, you should base yourself in Donegal Town. The town itself is charming—small but vibrant, with colorful storefronts and the iconic Donegal Castle perched nearby. I would recommend staying at the Central Hotel, located right in the heart of town on the diamond.

The Central Hotel is a historic property that has been welcoming guests for generations.The rooms was comfortable and clean, offering a perfect base for exploring the surrounding area.

### Exploring the Coastline

The next morning, I would set out early to explore Donegal's famous coastline. You can drive along the Wild Atlantic Way, stopping at scenic viewpoints and charming villages. The landscape is truly breathtaking—rolling green hills meeting dramatic cliffs that plunge into the Atlantic Ocean.

Spend an afternoon at Sliabh Liag (Slieve League), Ireland's highest sea cliffs. The views are incredible. You can see for miles across the ocean, all the way over to county Sligo.

### Evening Entertainment

Back in town that evening, I grabbed dinner at one of the local restaurants and enjoyed some traditional Irish music in a cozy pub. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, filled with locals and travelers alike all enjoying the craic.

### A Second Night and Day Trip

I spent my second night again at the Central Hotel, enjoying the breakfast spread and chatting with other guests in the hotel's welcoming bar. The staff had some great recommendations for day trips, and I took their advice to visit Glenveagh National Park.

Glenveagh is absolutely stunning—a vast estate with a beautiful castle, gardens, and hiking trails through wild terrain. I spent hours walking through the park, spotting local wildlife and taking in views of the surrounding mountains. If you have time during your visit to Donegal, this is an absolute must-see.

### Accommodations I'd Recommend

Besides the Central Hotel there are many other accomodation options I would recommend. For a luxure stay on the lake I would recommend Harvey's Point Hotel, just outside town on Lough Eske lake. 

I would also recommend Slieve League B&B, a cosy bed & breakfast close to the cliffs.

### Final Thoughts

If you're planning a trip to Ireland and want to venture beyond Dublin, I wholeheartedly recommend a visit to Donegal. Book yourself a room at the Central Hotel or one of the other wonderful properties in town, and prepare to have your heart stolen by this magical corner of the Emerald Isle.

The Wild Atlantic Way waits for no one—start planning your adventure today!
